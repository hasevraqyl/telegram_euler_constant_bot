# telegram_euler_constant_bot
A Telegram bot that performs calculations relating to the Euler constant.

Two modes allow to set either the precision or the number of cycles, and the bot returns either the number of cycles or the precision respectively, alongside the calculated value of the constant.

The modes are 'local', i.e. different for each user and stored during runtime.
